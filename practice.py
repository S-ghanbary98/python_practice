# 1. Declare function that takes in a username argument as as string. then returns the name.

#def username(name):
#   return name

# 2. Declare a list with numbers 1 - 5. Iterate through the list and display the list

#ls = [1,2, 3,4,5]

#for i in ls:
#    print(i)

# 3. AND - && & == Which one will return a boolean value.
#name = "Shervin"
#if name == "Shervin":

# Tuples are not mutable ()

# 5. Can we add an element to a list? Can we add an element to a tuple?, Can the element of tuples be of different types?
# Yes, No and Yes


# 6. Create a dictionary with key-value first_name and last_name
#dict = {"first_name": "Shervin","Last_name": "Ghanbary"}
#print(type(dict))
#dict["middle_name"] = "shervael"
#print(dict)

#Create a class called student, initalise the class and create an object of the class.


#class Student:
#    def __init__(self, name):
#        self.name = name


#student = Student("Chris")




# Create two functions that take two arguments each. Function one  = add values, function two subtract values.


def add(a, b):
    return a + b
